# my-mechatronics-projects
Repository for my final Mechatronics I & II (MECH 207/208) projects under Prof. Christopher Kitts. 
- Mechatronics I Final Project  *The objective of this project was to demonstrate basic sensing/control/actuation knowledge and hardware/electronics skills in a simple, functional end-to-end penny arcade machine system.
- Mechatronics II Final Project  * The purpose of this project was to develop a complete mechatronic control system that uses linear control principles to control a challenging dynamic 2nd order plant with macroscopic physical motion.
